# REQUESTS — every request the owner has made, and where it stands

**Standing practice from round 10 (2026-08-20).** One numbered row per request.
Every round updates this file, and **every end report closes by quoting this
file's OPEN and BUILT-DORMANT rows verbatim** — the point is that nothing the
owner asked for can go quiet.

## How to read a status

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `SHIPPED round-N` | Built, on `main`, and live on production unless the row says otherwise |
| `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-<step>` | The code is shipped and tested. It renders nothing, or does nothing, until the named step is taken **by the owner**. It is not waiting on this repo |
| `PARTIAL` | Part of the ask is live; the row names the part that is not |
| `OPEN` | Not built, not declined, not blocked on the owner. Work still owed |
| `DECLINED-because …` | Refused with reasoning. The reason is in the row so the next session does not re-propose it |

Two rules for whoever edits this next:

1. **A row is never deleted.** A request that turns out to be wrong becomes
   `DECLINED-because` with the reason; a request that gets superseded says so
   and points at the row that supersedes it.
2. **`BUILT-DORMANT` is not a synonym for `done`.** The owner still has a step
   to take, and the report has to say what it is. If a dormant row's step is
   ever taken, the row becomes `SHIPPED round-N` on the round that verifies it.

## 1. The three refusals that predate the redesign

Recorded in `SCOPE.md` §1 as contract v1.3 rulings. They are here so this file
is the single index and so nobody re-derives them from the design brief, which
is the input that produced the contract rather than its output.

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Exactly one skill level per game, never two | `DECLINED-because` `games.allowed_skill_levels` is a set on purpose — a game legitimately admits two adjacent levels. "Never two" is a data-model change wearing a card rule's clothing. Ruling I |
| 2 | Max one week ahead — no dates beyond that anywhere, the All Games view included | `DECLINED-because` hiding games from the list is the exact defect v1.1.6 C diagnosed. The **strip** caps at 8 boxes; the **list stays complete**. A game eleven days out that no surface shows cannot be booked. Ruling H |
| 3 | Delete a game outright, no record | `DECLINED-because` an event log with a hole in it is worse than an admin-visible cancelled game. Cancellation is additive; the game becomes `cancelled` and stays visible to admin. Ruling O |
| 4 | Cash-to-cash refunds (the second half of ruling O's "refund in kind") | `OPEN`, and quarantined — money has never left this system. `lib/policy.ts` sets `refundAs: "credit"` and there is no cash-refund path anywhere. **The trap:** reading "in kind" as a specification produces a cash-out feature the quarantine defers |
| 5 | "Non-refundable after 10hrs **unless you fill spot**" | `DECLINED-because` nothing records which cancellation a later booking answers — `spot_released` and `booking_created` are independent events. The clause was struck 2026-08-19 so the string table would not carry a promise no code can keep. The flat 10-hour rule shipped without it |

---

## 2. Quarantined in `SCOPE.md` §2 — and what has since been built

Eight items were quarantined behind backend capability. **Five have since been
requested again and built**, which is the interesting half of this table: the
quarantine held until the owner lifted it, item by item.

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | Per-game pitch names, typed at creation and reused from a dropdown | `SHIPPED round-9` — migration 41 applied (local + production, verified round 9 item 1). Free-text field with a `pitch_name_suggestions` datalist; every typed name is remembered, no save flag. Renders on the game detail. See row 51a for the label-language ruling |
| 7 | In-app notifications surface | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 5) — `notifications` table, bell in the header, admin compose. Migration applied and verified |
| 8 | Phone mandatory at signup | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 8) |
| 9 | Stripe checkout | `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-setting the Stripe env vars in Vercel`. Hosted Payment Links, not an integration: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_URL` (per-game) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PASS_URLS` (a JSON map of tier → link). Both unset today, so the online option renders as a gated placeholder and credits + cash work as they always have. Reconciliation is manual by design |
| 10 | Admin user search | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 9) — the admin player detail page |
| 11 | Admin ban / delete a player | `OPEN`, still quarantined — **ban is a new account state**, with consequences for bookings already held. Search was the cheap half and shipped; this is not |
| 12 | Pitches as an entity under venues (Pitch 1, 2, 3…) | `OPEN`, still quarantined — a new entity, an FK on `games`, admin CRUD, and a decision about what a pitch inherits from its venue. Row 6 is the front-end answer that avoided all of it |
| 13 | Organizer role management (dropdown, add, promote) | `OPEN`, still quarantined — organizers are a contact record, not an account type. It needs a role model the product does not have |
| 14 | Admin bulk credit issuance on cancellation | `OPEN` — may already exist inside the cancellation loop; needs reading before it is specified. Nobody has read it yet |

## 3. The redesign rounds

### Rounds 0–2 (night run, `staging/v13`)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | Rulings R1–R9, branch law, the pitch photograph | `SHIPPED round-0` |
| 16 | Chrome: nav, header, ADMIN badge, avatar | `SHIPPED round-1` |
| 17 | The list card over the pitch photograph | `SHIPPED round-2` |
| 18 | List density — how many whole cards above the fold | `SHIPPED round-3` as **two**, ratified by the owner after the run reported it could not reach three. R10 |
| 19 | Make the card outline thicker | `SHIPPED round-3`. It had silently not rendered for two rounds: Chrome snaps `border-[1.5px]` to the device grid and **reports it as 1px**, so the spec asserting 1px agreed with the bug. Everything is `border-2`. R11 |
| 20 | Nav bar: flush band or inset cells | `SHIPPED round-3` — **the frames win**, the owner's second reversal on this element. The band is flush and full-bleed; the cells take a 12px inset with a 6px gap. R12 |

### Rounds 3–6 (overnight run, merged and deployed)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 21 | Home + Games per `p01`, `p02` | `SHIPPED round-3` |
| 22 | Game detail per `p03`, including R6(b)'s header-band photo fade | `SHIPPED round-4` — one header band for every game, replacing two. R13 |
| 23 | Auth restyle per `p08`, `p09` | `SHIPPED round-5` |
| 24 | Profile per `p10`, `p11` | `SHIPPED round-6` |
| 25 | `p08`'s "Continue with Google" | See row 27 — round 5 declined to paint a dead button (R15); round 7 built the flow behind a flag |
| 26 | Forgot-password: do not invent a design for a screen with no frame | `SHIPPED round-5` as "leave it working, restyle only the box". Superseded by row 47, which built the screen in the product's own shell rather than from a frame |

### Round 7 (twelve items, supervised)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 27 | Google sign-in | `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-setting NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH=1 and configuring Google OAuth in Supabase`. The flow ships; `components/auth/GoogleAuthBlock.tsx` returns null while the flag is unset, and a spec fails if anyone renders it unconditionally |
| 28 | Change email | `SHIPPED round-7` |
| 29 | Game-pill photo fade | `SHIPPED round-7` |
| 30 | Admin frames (`p14`–`p19`) mapping check | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 0) — and it found the audit wrong: `p15` is add-player, `p16` is the new-venue block **inside** `/admin/games/new`, `p19` is `/admin/stats`, `p12` is home's community section. Only `p13` was genuinely new |
| 31 | New game flow, financials page, admin player detail | `SHIPPED round-7` |
| 32 | Payment UI: three options | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 11) — three options with the online one gated. See row 9 |
| 33 | Pass purchase links, one env var, JSON map of tier → link | `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-pasting the JSON map into Vercel` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PASS_URLS`. The template with every real tier identifier as a key was printed for the owner in the round 7 report |
| 34 | Stripe redirect params — `client_reference_id` and `prefilled_email` on every outgoing link | `SHIPPED round-7` (item 16), asserted on the outgoing URL. Dormant in effect, because row 9's links are unset |

### Round 8 (fourteen items)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 35 | Seed prices to 150 CZK | `PARTIAL` — the seed and scaffold are corrected and `docs/ops/reprice-games-150.sql` exists, self-guarding and dry-run first. **It matches zero production rows today**, so nothing is owed unless a 200 CZK game appears. Ruling F |
| 36 | The `p14` dashboard | `SHIPPED round-8`, and **rebuilt in round 10** — see row 49 |
| 37 | Financials CSV export | `SHIPPED round-8` (item 3) |
| 38 | Detail-page header photo sliver, list-card fade boundary, badge pills | `SHIPPED round-8`. The fade work uncovered R19: Tailwind gradient stops are on a **5% scale** — `via-52%`, `to-72%` and `to-92%` generate **nothing**, and three surfaces had shipped with no stop positions at all |
| 39 | Organizer contact over WhatsApp | `SHIPPED round-8`, and made private in round 9 — the number was in the page source. See row 43 |
| 40 | "Your next game" box, profile banner, three payment options | `SHIPPED round-8` |
| 41 | **Fidelity pass — several surfaces "barely resemble their frames", `p14` named** | `PARTIAL` at round 8 (R20), **closed for `p14` in round 10** — see row 49. The finding was that "different feel" lived in surface treatment, label colour and one type step, not in missing elements |

### Round 9 (eight items)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 42 | Verify the three migrations are applied | `SHIPPED round-9` — notifications, profile_cover and pitch_name confirmed on local **and** production |
| 43 | WhatsApp privacy: the organizer's number must not be in the page source | `SHIPPED round-9` — `/api/wa/[gameId]` 302s to `wa.me` with the digits and the prefilled text built server-side, `cache-control: no-store`, 404 when there is no number |
| 44 | Badges: record the `p03` size divergence as deliberate | `SHIPPED round-9` — R21. The `size` prop is **removed** rather than defaulted, so no call site can quietly reintroduce per-instance sizing |
| 45 | Extend the profile cover and **measure** the contrast | `SHIPPED round-9` (item 4) — extended to 245px. Measuring is what caught the bug: the absolute cover was painting over `ProfileStats`, max luminance 37 across the stats band, numerals not on screen. The same stacking class as the round-6 nickname bug |
| 46 | Merge the admin game pages; remove the drafts section | `SHIPPED round-9` |
| 47 | Forgot password, built | `SHIPPED round-9` (item 8) — `/login/reset` in the product's own shell. No design invented, because there is still no frame |
| 48 | **Apply `20260820160000_cover_key_and_grants.sql` to production** | `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-the owner running the migration`. Applied locally and verified; **not** applied to production. Until it is, a cover upload on production **saves a row but not the image**. The command is in every end report and is repeated at the bottom of this file |

### Round 10 (three items)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 49 | **`/admin` = `p14`, uncapped — the fifth time this has been asked** | `SHIPPED round-10` (item 1). Side-by-side at 390px, iterated until the comparison stopped producing findings. Pinned by `e2e/strips-admin-dashboard.spec.ts`, which is the first spec this page has ever had — round 8's version could drift because nothing failed when it did. Residual divergences are listed in §4 below |
| 50 | This file | `SHIPPED round-10` (item 2) |
| 51 | The pitch-name admin form label stays English | `SHIPPED round-10` (item 3) — see §5 |
| 52 | *Not a request — a finding raised by row 49, filed here because R23 promises it a row.* `page-title` is probably one step too loud product-wide | `OPEN`, and it is the owner's call. Every frame measured — `p02`, `p05`, `p10`, `p11`, `p18` as well as all four admin ones — draws its page title at a **23.4px cap**. `page-title` renders 28.2; `title` renders 21.3. R17 added the step on the reading that our titles were "a third smaller than the design", and the pixels disagree. Correcting it moves **nineteen headings** across home, games, auth, pass and profile — surfaces nobody asked about in round 10, which is why admin was fixed alone. R23 |

### Round 11 (one feature, two halves)

| # | Request | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 53 | **Admin guests replace shadow players** — remove the shadow-creation and merge flows from the UI; admin adds and removes simple auto-named guests that consume capacity | `SHIPPED round-11` (A). Guests are a count on the game, not a `players` row: `players_nickname_key` is unique on `lower(nickname)`, so "Guest 1" could exist once in the whole database. `merge_players` and `claim_shadow_player` survive as RPCs with no UI — the first is the only repair for a split identity that already exists, the second is how a pre-round-11 shadow is claimed at sign-in |
| 54 | Existing shadow players must keep rendering as guests, with no data loss | `SHIPPED round-11`. **No backfill and no row touched.** A shadow IS `players.auth_user_id is null`, and the roster view projects that as `is_guest`, so they became guests by definition rather than by migration — and they keep their own names. One that is later claimed gains an auth user and stops being a guest, which is correct |
| 55 | **Party booking (+1/+2/+3)** — one booking, N+1 seats, guest avatars at the end of the row | `SHIPPED round-11` (B). `bookings.guest_count`; `price_czk` is the whole party's, which is what lets the variable symbol, the credit application, the confirmation email and `cancel_booking` work untouched. The ceiling is `policy.booking.maxPartyGuests` **and** a constant inside `create_booking_internal` — the second policy window that lives in two places, for the same reason the cancellation cutoff does |
| 56 | Party payment: credits only when the balance covers all N+1, cash as today, online with an explicit "set quantity to N" line | `SHIPPED round-11`. The credit rule is DERIVED rather than corrected after the fact: growing the party past the wallet un-checks the option in the same render, because an effect would fix it one frame late and that frame is the one where Confirm is pressable. The quantity line exists because a Stripe Payment Link carries a fixed quantity of one and no parameter presets it |
| 57 | **Apply `20260821100000_guests_and_parties.sql` to production** | `BUILT-DORMANT-ON-the owner running the migration`. Validated against the local database and rolled back; 23 SQL assertions pass. **Until it runs, production has no `guest_count` columns** — the deployed code would ask for a column that is not there, so this migration and the deploy belong together. Command in §6 |

---

## 4. `p14`: what still differs, and why each one is not code

Round 10's brief was to iterate until the divergence list was empty **except
items physically impossible without a new frame**. It is. What remains:

| Divergence | Why it is not buildable from this frame |
|---|---|
| Rows carry a sequential number, `#62`…`#67` | `games` has no sequential id and nothing in the schema orders games that way. A surrogate display number is a schema decision, not a paint one |
| The organizer reads `Gabriel +668` | A name plus a three-digit fragment. `organizer_phone` exists, but the frame does not say what the number is — last three digits, an extension, a placeholder — and inventing a meaning puts a wrong fact in an admin list |
| Revenue reads `$12,350` | **Money is Czech in every language** (CLAUDE.md). The frame's dollars are a mock artefact; ours reads `750 CZK` |
| The frame shows six upcoming rows, ours shows five | Seed data. The query takes six |
| Ours has a site footer; the frame ends at the nav pill | Not admin-specific: **none of the nineteen frames draws the footer.** A global chrome question, not a `p14` one |
| The header shows an avatar and a flag where the frame draws a person glyph and `EN ▾` | Round-1 chrome, already reviewed, shared by every page |

---

## 5. Rulings recorded without code

| # | Ruling | Recorded |
|---|---|---|
| 51a | **The pitch-name admin form label stays English.** The admin panel is English-only by standing rule; carving admin into the i18n overlays is **declined as disproportionate** — it is a surface only the owner and organizers see, and `lib/i18n/__tests__/i18n.test.ts` actively forbids translating outside the player-facing sections. Player-facing pitch-name rendering — the data join that puts the name on the game detail — is unaffected and stays as built | Round 10, item 3 |

---

## 6. Standing owner actions

**Two commands are outstanding.** They are rows 48 and 57, repeated here
because a dormant row at the bottom of a table is a row that gets skimmed.

**Round 11's migration, and it is the urgent one** — the deployed code reads
`games.guest_count` and `bookings.guest_count`, and production has neither
until this runs:

```bash
node scripts/apply-migration.mjs \
  supabase/migrations/20260821100000_guests_and_parties.sql --production
```

It adds two columns with defaults, one function, one RPC, and rewrites
`game_roster_public` to emit a row per seat. It is additive: no row changes and
nothing is dropped except the four-argument `create_booking`, which the new
five-argument one replaces. Rollback is
`supabase/rollback/20260821100000_guests_and_parties_down.sql`.

**Round 9's, still outstanding:**

```bash
node scripts/apply-migration.mjs \
  supabase/migrations/20260820160000_cover_key_and_grants.sql --production
```

Until it runs, **a profile cover uploaded on production saves a database row
and no image.** The `--production` flag is deliberate and cannot be replaced by
an environment variable — see CLAUDE.md on why implicitness is what failed.

**Three environment variables are unset**, and each holds a shipped feature
dormant: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AUTH` (row 27),
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_URL` (row 9), `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PASS_URLS`
(row 33).

**One data statement is outstanding** and needs no migration file — the venue
separator moved from an em-dash to a bullet in the fixtures and production rows
still carry the old one. It is in CLAUDE.md under "Migrations applied to
production".
